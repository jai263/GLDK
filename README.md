# 🚀 AuraCommerce - GitHub Pages Guide

You can host this website for FREE using only GitHub. 

## 📦 Step 1: Upload Files
1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Make sure you see **individual files** (`index.html`, `App.tsx`, etc.). 
3. **DO NOT** have a ZIP file or a main folder.

## ⚙️ Step 2: Turn on the Website
1. Click the **Settings** tab at the top of your GitHub repo.
2. On the left sidebar, click **Pages**.
3. Under **Branch**, change "None" to **main**.
4. Click **Save**.
5. Wait about 60 seconds. Refresh the page, and you will see a link like:
   `https://yourname.github.io/your-repo/`

## 🛠 Why is there a 404.html?
GitHub Pages is simple. If you are on the "Admin" page and you hit **Refresh**, GitHub thinks that page doesn't exist. The `404.html` file tells GitHub: "It's okay, just stay on the website and keep working!" 

## 📊 Step 3: Connect Your Spreadsheet
1. Open your new website link.
2. Click **Admin** (Default Password: `admin`).
3. Go to **Settings**.
4. Click **"How to Setup Sheets"** and follow the 4 simple steps to start receiving orders in your Google Sheet.

## 💰 Step 4: Setup Payments
1. In **Admin > Settings**, enter your **UPI ID**.
2. Customers will now see your GPay QR code when they buy something!
